Courses are opened the Wednesday prior to the official start date in order to provide students extra time to review syllabi, view their digital textbook, and browse through available content and activities. Additionally, course end dates are managed through PostMan to allow students additional time to check their grades and/or complete any late work allowed by their instructors. The best part is that this is well within the free use of the PostMan tool!</p><p>Take a journey with the Dallas College LMS System Admins and let us show you the magic and fun of using PostMan to save time, headaches, and your sanity!</p>",Learning Exchange Showcase (60 minutes),LMS Site Admin and IT Effectiveness,Higher Education,Advanced,<p><strong>Angela Bryant</strong><br />Dallas College</p><p><strong>Kyler Copsey</strong><br />Dallas College</p>

A limitation within the quiz performance tool is its inability to filter data by section, presenting a challenge for educators aiming to analyze quiz outcomes by specific class segments. In this presentation, we will discuss how Temasek Polytechnic, Singapore navigated this challenge by employing Brightspace&rsquo;s Insights Report Builder. This tool facilitates data preparation and the creation of visualized reports on student quiz performance, featuring section-based filtering.

By partnering with key players in various sectors, we can develop tailored curricula that focus on the specific skills and competencies demanded by employers. Saskatchewan Polytechnic has passionately pursued the development of micro-credentials in many sectors including business, computers and technology, sustainability, entrepreneurship, and manufacturing. Micro-credentials are essential in meeting learners where they are at in their educational journey and providing competency-based learning in a way that fill gaps in knowledge and provides the necessary upskilling or re-skilling to meet industry demands. In this presentation we will cover topics such as completing an environmental scan, assessing our learner profiles, utilizing skilled instructional designers, consulting and leaning on subject matter expertise, and integrating assessments. Our micro-credentials at Sask Polytech are providing the content to learners on a when needed basis in a format that is targeted to the learners. In this presentation we will also discuss the steps that we have been taking to plan for micro-credentials that align with our credit programming to provide the ultimate upskilling opportunity and to allow for learners to move into a larger program of study after taking a micro-credential and utilizing a PLAR system to receive credit towards that program.",Standard Breakout (45 minutes),"Certification, Micro-Credentialing, Competency-based Learning",Higher Education,Novice,<p><strong>Ann Reinhart</strong><br />Saskatchewan Polytechnic</p>
